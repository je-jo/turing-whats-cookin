# What's Cookin

## Abstract 

A recipe tracking / meal planning application that allows users to view recipes they want to cook and plan shopping trips around them. Users should view a list of recipes and choose recipes to cook.

This is a learning project from Turing School Module 2. The spec can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-2/whats-cookin-part-one.html).

## Learning Goals

- Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
- Create a user interface that is easy to use and clearly displays information.
- Write DRY, reusable code that follows SRP and trends toward function purity
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
- Make network requests to retrieve data
